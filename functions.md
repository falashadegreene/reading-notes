# *Functions*

### What is function in Javascript? 

A function is considered a procedure that contains statements that can perform a task or calculates a value. In order to create a function you must define it somewhere in the scope. 

### Defining a function

Declaring or stating a function consists of keywords 

- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

`function square(number) { return number * number; }`

### Control Flow 

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes scripts. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. Example of control flow below.

`if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}`
