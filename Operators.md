# **Operators and Loops**

## Operators 

In Javascript there are many operators. A few common operators are Assignment Operators and Comparison Operators.


### Assignment Operators 

A assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are a few examples of assignment operators. 

 > - Addition assignment
 > - Subtraction assignment 
 > - Multiplication assignment 
 > - Division assignment

### Comparison Operators 

A Comparison Operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. Here are a few comparison Operators

> -  Equal (==)
> -  Not equal (!=)
> -  Strict equal (===)
> -  Strict not equal (!==)
> -  Greater than (>)
> -  Greater than or equal (>=)
> -  Less than (<)
> -  Less than or equal (<=)

### loops 

A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied. A few examples are a "foor loop" and "while loop".

* For loop -  loops through a block of code a number of times
* While loop - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
