# **GIT Intro**

## What is Git and how does it work? 

Git is a DVCS (Distribution Version Control System) that stores data in your local file system. Anytime you make changes or commits Git creates a snapshot of the data and stores it as a reference. Git is essentially a tracking system that allows you to save changes and dectects any corruptions or losses to your files.

## Git workflow
* Working Directory - add 
* Index - Commit 
* Head 

## Git Commands 
* git status -- To determine that state of files 
* git add filename -- Tracks one file
* git commit -m -- Make change with message
* git commit -a -- commiting all changes
* git push origin master -- Push changes to remote repo 

> *Git is a great tool for tracking files and working in repos in effective collaborative way*
