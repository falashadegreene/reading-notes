### The command line

I learned the command line is a feature or interface that allows you to use text as a way to navigate the computer file system. There are commands you can use as navigation to locate different files. below are a few simple command prompts.

#### examples:

1. pwd= print working directory 
2. ls= short for list
3. cd = change directory 
4. mkdir = make directory (folder)

The command line is an important tool when working in multiple files on the computer. It allows you to work more efficiently when working on multiple projects at once.
