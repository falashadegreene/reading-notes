## About me 

## My name is Falashade. Nice to meet you!

I currently live in the Maryland area. I'm new to learning software development and very excited to continue my learning path with Code Fellows. 

### **Growth mindset**

My definition of _Growth Mindset_ is having the ability to believe in the process of learning something new. It is important to remember with practice and dedication that you'll be alot further along than when you started. 

**Three things to remember:**

- Always remember to ask questions if you feel stuck.
- The more you practice and use your resources the less hard it will feel.
- Challenges are apart of the learning process. It will get better! 

> *Don't give up, you got this!*
