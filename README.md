### **Growth mindset**

My definition of _Growth Mindset_ is having the ability to believe in the process of learning something new. It is important to remember with practice and dedication that you'll be alot further along than when you started. 

**Three things to remember:**

- Always remember to ask questions if you feel stuck.
- The more you practice and use your resources the less hard it will feel.
- Challenges are apart of the learning process. It will get better! 

> *Don't give up, you got this!*
